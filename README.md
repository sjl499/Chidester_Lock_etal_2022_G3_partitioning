# Chidester_Lock_etal_2022_G3_partitioning
Repository containing functions to implement the partitioning formulation and fits presented in Chidester, Lock, et al., 2022.
#Developer: Simon Lock, s.lock@bristol.ac.uk

Overview:
The repository contains the functions necessary to calculate the partitioning coefficients of elements using the model of Chidester, Lock, et al., 2022. The jupyter notebook 'calc_partitioning_example.ipyb' steps through the process of calculating the coefficients for a given pressure, temperature and composition. The functions 'calc_KD_res.py' and 'io_fits.py' are necessary for calculating partitioning coefficients and are part of a larger partitioning fitting package that will be made available shortly. The other directories in the repository contain the fits presented in Chidester & Lock et al. (2022).
